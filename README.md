# Tutoring
It takes place on:
- Monday **16:30 - 17:30**
- Wednesday **16:30 - 18:00**
- Thursday **16:30 - 18:00**

---

## Examples
In folders starting with **examples-** you will find samples of code from specific topics. This is a good place to learn the syntax and see some simple stuff in action.

## Exercises
Tasks done during tutoring will be stored in folders **JS-XX** or **HTML-CSS-XX**.

## Solutions
Almost always I will attach solutions to the tasks. If you have some problems than have a look how I did it, maybe it will help. Just don't copy the whole solution...

*In case of questions or task requests write me on slack or drop an email karol.polakowski@digitalcareerinstitute.org*
