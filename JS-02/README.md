# Javascript exercise 14/08/2019
## Prerequisites
```javascript
let sentence = "Hello world. This is my first sentence. I just learned how to speak.";
```
*Try to keep all functions pure! It means that it shouldn't modify anything outside of it's scope.*
## Tasks to do:
1. Write a function `capitaliseWords()`, that will transform first letter from each word in string to uppercase and return it as a new string.
2. Write a function that will print how many vowels (`"a","e","i","o","u","y"`) string has.
3. Write a function that will reverse the order of each word in the string (for example `Hello world` should be `olleH dlrow`). Don't change the order of the words.
4. Write a function that will return the longest word in the sentence.

## Extra task
5. Transform function from a task `#1` to a prototype function so you can use it on any String.
6. Write a custom reduce function that works the same as original and add it to Array prototype object.
